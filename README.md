👋 Hi, I'm Rémi, a passionate software engineer and tech explorer! 

🔧 I specialize in cross-platform mobile development with `Flutter`. I'm also proficient in the JavaScript ecosystem (`Node.js`, `React`, `React Native`, `Expo`, `Express`, `MongoDB`) and have experience with `Java`/`Spring` for backend development. 

💡 I'm always eager to learn more about programming, especially software architecture (SOLID, OOP, Clean Code, TDD...), to build maintainable and scalable systems.

🚀 I co-founded [OrdoSafe](https://www.ordosafe.fr/), a solution to combat medical fraud in France.

💻 **Currently**: Freelancer at [ViaMichelin](https://www.viamichelin.fr/)  
🏗️ **Building & experimenting**: Always testing new side projects to explore the latest tech. Currently diving into `Go` to broaden my backend skills. 🔧  

🔙 **Previously worked at:** [Théodo Apps](https://apps.theodo.com/) and [Swappy](https://www.swappy.fr/)
